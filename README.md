## Please consider this repo depricated!

**Instead visit the outstanding and well maintained [NVIDIA Deep Learning Examples](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples) repository**

I'll remove this repo at some point since it is no longer necessary.

**Best wishes to All! --dbk**


This is a copy of the nvidia-examples directory from the NVIDIA NGC TensorFlow 1.15 container image (tagged 20.10-tf1-py3). There are many very useful example scripts, included here for convenience.  Note: The tensorrt subdirectory not included because of size.

Please use with attribution to the great folks at NVIDIA and the Google TensorFlow team and community.
